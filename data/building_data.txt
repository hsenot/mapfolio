Getting building data:

Create a structure to host the building data:
CREATE TABLE osm_buildings
(
  osm_id integer NOT NULL,
  building text,
  name text,
  addr_housenumber character varying,
  addr_street character varying,
  addr_city character varying,
  addr_postcode character varying,
  the_geom geometry(Geometry,4326),
  CONSTRAINT osm_building_pk PRIMARY KEY (osm_id )
)

Download the buildings data file from:
